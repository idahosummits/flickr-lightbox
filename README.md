```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="lightbox.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="gallery-div" data-flickr-user="FLICKR_USER_ID" data-flickr-photoset="FLICKR_PHOTOSET_ID"></div>

## Getting Flickr IDs
* You can use [http://idgettr.com/](http://idgettr.com/) to find a Flickr User ID.
* A Flickr Photoset's ID can be found by looking at the end of the url of an album page on Flickr. For example, [this album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/parismadrid/sets/72157649350793497) has a Photoset ID of 72157649350793497, since its URL is:
`https://www.flickr.com/photos/parismadrid/sets/72157649350793497`
